By default, this folder can be served by virtual web server nodes in VNS
topologies.  They cannot serve directories above this one -- unless a symlink or
shortcut is located in this folder or one of its subfolders.

It is suggested that you place each website you want a virtual web server to
serve in its own subfolder within this folder.  The VNS web interface allows you
to then designate which subfolder (if any) to serve from within this folder.
